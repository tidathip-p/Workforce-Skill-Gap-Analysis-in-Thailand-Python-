# 📘 Workforce Skill Gap Analysis in Thailand using Python

This project is a spinoff from the research project at Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) titled “Development of a Data Analysis System Using Large Language Models (LLMs) for High-Competency Workforce Alignment with National Needs,” funded by the National Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation Policy Council (NXPO), Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, Kingdom of Thailand.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze workforce skill gaps by scraping and examining over 500,000 online job seekers' profiles from various Thai job portals. The insights aim to assist educational institutions and policymakers in aligning curricula with market demands.

## 🔍 Interesting Points

- Surge in Demand for Digital Skills: Industries such as e-commerce, fintech, and software development are experiencing rapid growth, leading to a heightened demand for professionals skilled in data analysis, coding, and digital marketing.
- Emphasis on Language Proficiency: Employers are increasingly seeking candidates proficient in languages such as Mandarin, English, and Japanese, reflecting the globalized nature of the job market.
- Aging Workforce and Skills Mismatch: Thailand's rapidly aging population is leading to workforce shortages in sectors like healthcare and manufacturing, highlighting the need for reskilling and retention strategies.
- Rise of the Gig Economy: There's a noticeable shift towards freelance and short-term contract work, offering flexibility but also presenting challenges in terms of job security and benefits.

## 📰 Source

- The labor market data used in this project is being collected from 15 popular job portals in Thailand. Currently, data collection is underway. While the broader project involves scraping and analyzing job and resume data from a total of 15 portals, this portfolio currently highlights work completed on [*JobPub.com*](https://www.jobpub.com/) as the first phase. Data collection from additional sites is ongoing and will be integrated in future stages.
